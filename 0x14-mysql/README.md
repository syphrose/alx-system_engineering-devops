Database administration

A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating.

SQL Replication
If your important data is stored in an SQL database (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, etc.), you can take advantage of some built-in replication features. These can be used to provide a failover system in case the main server goes down.
