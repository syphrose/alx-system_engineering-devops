On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

### Specifics
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From the first task, add;
a) 2 servers
b) 1 web server (Nginx)
c) 1 application server
d) 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
e) 1 set of application files (your code base)
f) 1 database (MySQL)

Then explain;
~ For every additional element, why you are adding it
~ What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
~ Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
~ How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
~ What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
~ Where are SPOF
~ Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
~ No monitoring

### Elaboration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- In this task, the server should contain a web server, app server, database 
and codebase to provide redundancy with other servers .
- The load balancer and the SPOF distributes traffic between the added servers in an 
Active-active and Active-passive setup.
- MySQL Master-Replica cluster used replication to keep the data synchronized(harmonize or integrate).
- Master database node can accept read/writes while Replica only accepts reads.
- There's no firewall on the servers as well as unencrypted traffic which might lead to failure if a new code
is deployed.
- Lack of a monitoring unit  means there won't be an alert if something is unusual ie though
overloaded CPU, disk, memory or network.
