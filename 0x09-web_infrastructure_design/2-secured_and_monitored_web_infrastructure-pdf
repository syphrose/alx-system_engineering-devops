On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com,
it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

### Specifics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the structure in task 2 add;
* 3 firewalls
* 1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
* 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)

The explain the concept behind;
- For every additional element, why you are adding it
- What are firewalls for
- Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
- What monitoring is used for
- How the monitoring tool is collecting data
- Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
- Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
- Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
- Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem.

### Elaboration
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The addition of three firewalls helps in filtering the network traffic in and out of a machine.
- Setting up of HTTPS prevents reading if someone intercepts the traffic without permission.
- Monitoring can be done to check if there is an alert about anything unusual. Its composed of a client
collecting  data and sending it to the monitoring system.
- it's configured to collect webserver data. It has an alert triggered if QPS is getting out of control.
- Termination of SSL at the Load-balancer level, brings an issue since the traffic between it and the web servers is unencrypted.
- One MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue because if the master goes down, the app can't write to the database anymore.
- The server with all the same component might affect the other components on it when there is maintenance is done on a server
for a specif component.
This can as well make their consumption not to grow the same way between each of them.
- The load-balancer is a SPOF in this case.
