Scaling up
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- NGINX - is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server.
- In a typical deployment, a website that provides both static and dynamically generated content runs
web servers for the static content and application servers to generate content dynamically.
- A reverse proxy and load balancer sit in front of one or more web servers and one or more web application
servers to route traffic to the appropriate server, first based on the type of content requested and then based
on the configured load-balancing algorithm.
- Most load balancer programs are also reverse proxy servers, which simplifies web application server architecture.

In this task you must add;
- 1 server
- 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one
- Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server

### Explanations
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The additional server.
With additional load-balancer configured as a cluster so that if one fails the one takes over.
The added server contains single components inside them ie (web server, app server or database)
