Web infrastructure design
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web infrastructure design refers to the process of planning, organizing, and implementing the hardware, software, and network resources that are needed to support the goals of a website or web-based application. This involves choosing the right technologies and platforms, determining the best ways to connect and manage the different components, and ensuring that the infrastructure is scalable, reliable, and secure. Good web infrastructure design is essential for ensuring that a website or application can handle a large number of users, handle complex tasks, and provide a high-quality user experience without so much breakdowns or interferences.
