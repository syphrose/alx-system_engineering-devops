On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

### Specifics
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In this specific task, I am to use;
a) 1 server
b) 1 web server (Nginx)
c) 1 application server
d) 1 application files (your code base)
e) 1 database (MySQL)
f) 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8

### Elaboration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Server is located in a data center. It could be physical or virtual and runs an Operating System.
- The Web Server serves web-pages and application server computes dynamic content.
- The database stores the application's data.
- The DNS(Domain Name System) trnslates the record of a domain name into an IP address. For instance,
the www.foobar.com is an A record since it resolves to an IP address.
- The server is a single point of failure as nothing there is redundant, ie unnecessary.
- If a new code is deployed and the web server need a restart, the website would be temporarily down. This is
because there is no firewall or HTTPS to control security of the traffic.
- This construction on the other hand can't  scale up and won't be able to handle traffic that would exceed the
server capacity.
